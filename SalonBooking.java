/**
 * This is a school project for the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course at Umm Al-Qura University (UQU).
 * The program consists of a collection of classes designed to improve users' salon experience through a beauty salon UI.
 * Our program's primary goal is to streamline salon reservations.
 * Users can select desired services, update reservation details (such as time or date),
 * choose a stylist within their budget, view stylist and service information, generate reservation receipts,
 * apply discounts if desired (discarded due to time constraints), and finally, cancel the reservation.
